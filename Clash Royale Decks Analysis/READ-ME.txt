Hello! This is a small data analysis project of mine
that creates a data frame containing the top seasonal
decks or palettes of chracters from the mobile video
game called "Clash Royale."

The deck analyzes what characters appear in these
top seasonal decks and determines whether they are
overrepresented or underrepresented compared to the
general population of all characters that exist in the
game.

The characters are that overrepresented in the most recent
season are most likely to get nerfed in the upcoming season,
and vice-versa.

I used RStudio to utilize the .rmd file, so please use that for
the best experience.
